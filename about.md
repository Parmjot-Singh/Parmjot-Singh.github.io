### Something about me
I am a person who likes tinkering with stuff so much, that it breaks.
I love tech, and how every small thing that you change can make it your own. I enjoy coding, browsing the web, and playing [TrackMania](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfLecAWFQIc) I love being creative, and enjoy taking on challenges. I also love learning new skills, and love using them. I enjoy doing things practically, but I don't like theory. Who likes theory?

I need to add more stuff.
