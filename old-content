about me
I am a person who likes tinkering with stuff so much, that it breaks.
I love tech, and how every small thing that you change can make it your own. I enjoy coding, browsing the web, and playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfLecAWFQIc" target="_blank" class="hover-underline-animation">TrackMania</a>. I have a bunch of small side projects, which you can check out at my Github (top right). I have no proper apps yet though. I am learning Python, and HTML. I want to learn C++, C#, and Rust.
I love being creative, and enjoy taking on challenges. I also love learning new skills, and love using them. I enjoy doing things practically, but I don't like theory. Who likes theory?
Currently, I am in High School, and want to go for a Software Engineering degree when I get to University.
I need to add more stuff.
