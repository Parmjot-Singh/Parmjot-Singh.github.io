				about me
			</h3>
			<p>
				I love tech, and how every small thing that you change can make it your own. I enjoy coding, browsing the web, and playing TrackMania. I have a bunch of small side projects, which you can check out at my Github (top right). I have no proper apps yet though.
			</p>
			<p>
				I love being creative, and enjoy taking on challenges. I also love learning new skills, and love using them. I enjoy doing things practically, but I don't like theory. Who likes theory?
			</p>
			<p>
				Currently, I am in High School, and want to go for a Software Engineering degree when I get to University.
			</p>
			<br>
			I need to add more stuff.

			Parmjot Singh made this website, and it's hosted on Github.

			Someone make a <a href="https://github.com/Parmjot-Singh/Parmjot-Singh.github.io/issues/new" class="a-hr">issue report</a> if you think anything else should belong here.
